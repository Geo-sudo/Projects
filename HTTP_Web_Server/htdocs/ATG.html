    <h1>Alexander's Speech at the Hyphasis River</h1>
    
    <div class="speech-text">
        <p>I observe that when I am eager to lead you on to further exploits, you no longer follow me with your customary spirit.</p>
        <p>I have led you through dangers and hardships that you have overcome by your own valor, and now, when the great work is almost finished, you falter.</p>
        <p>For brave men, the end of labors is the reward which follows the performance of the labors themselves, and for those who have toiled, it is life to return home conspicuous in glory and the admiration of all men.</p>
        <p>We are not far from the River Ganges and the Eastern Sea. If we turn back now, the nations we have conquered will rise against us. But if we cross the Ganges, we shall secure the unity of our empire, and there will be no limit to our domination.</p>
        <p>Do you not know that toil and danger are the price of glory, and that sweet is the memory of it when the danger is past? It is the prerogative of the brave to live honorably and to die gloriously.</p>
        <p>I ask you not to be dismayed by the names of far-off lands, nor by the notion that these are endless wars. The country beyond this point is rich, and the prizes awaiting us are worthy of our great enterprise. </p>
        <p>Continue your march, and I will make the men who remain with me the envy of all mankind, that they may return home not merely as common soldiers, but as rulers.</p>
